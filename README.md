Hello world, my name is Jiang jinshan, I'm chinese from Sichuan china, I'm currently working in a public company in laser industry, but I want to make some changes to my career, so I started to learn coding, right now I'm just at the beginning of my study journey, starting with the web developing, later will further my study on machine learning and artificial intelligence.
I don't want to waste to much time on writing the README file, getting back to study.
